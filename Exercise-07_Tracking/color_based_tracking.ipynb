    "# Color-based Tracking\n",
    "moves away from tracking individual pixel gradients (like KLT) and instead focuses on tracking the **statistical distribution of colors** within a region. The two primary algorithms for this are **Mean Shift** and its improved version, **CamShift**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Mean Shift Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Shift is an iterative method for finding the \"peak\" or \"mode\" of a data distribution. In tracking, we use it to find the area in the current frame that most closely matches the **color histogram** of the object from the previous frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Target:** You select a region (ROI) in the first frame.\n",
    "2. **Color Histogram:** You create a histogram of the target, typically in the **HSV color space** (Hue-Saturation-Value), because it is more robust to lighting changes than RGB.\n",
    "3. **Backprojection:** In the next frame, every pixel is replaced with its probability of belonging to that color histogram. This creates a \"probability map\" where the target looks like a bright blob.\n",
    "4. **The \"Shift\":** The algorithm starts a window at the last known position and calculates the **center of mass** of the probability map inside that window. It then moves (shifts) the window to that center.\n",
    "5. **Convergence:** This repeats until the window stops moving—it has found the \"peak\" concentration of the target color.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CamShift (Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Mean Shift has one major problem: the size of the tracking window stays constant. If an object moves toward the camera (getting larger) or away (getting smaller), Mean Shift fails to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CamShift** solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Running Mean Shift first to find the center.\n",
    "2. **Updating the window size:** It adjusts the window size based on the distribution of the color pixels.\n",
    "3. **Orientation:** It calculates the orientation of the object (e.g., if a person leans over), allowing the bounding box to rotate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
