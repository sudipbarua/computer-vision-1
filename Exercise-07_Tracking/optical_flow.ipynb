    "# Optical Flow and the Lucas-Kanade Method\n",
    "This is a fundamental shift from finding features in a single image to tracking how they move across a sequence of frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Optical Flow: The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Assumption: Brightness Constancy\n",
    "\n",
    "For Optical Flow to work, we assume that the intensity (brightness) of a moving pixel does not change between Frame 1 and Frame 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(x, y, t) = I(x+dx, y+dy, t+dt)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the **Optical Flow Constraint Equation**:\n",
    "$$f_x u + f_y v + f_t = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $f_x, f_y$: Image gradients (change in space).\n",
    "* $f_t$: Temporal gradient (change in time).\n",
    "* $u, v$: The velocity vector we want to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** We have one equation but two unknowns ( and ). This is known as the **Aperture Problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Lucas-Kanade Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the Aperture Problem, Lucas and Kanade (1981) proposed that we assume all pixels in a small local window (e.g., 3X3) move with the **same velocity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of one equation, we now have 9 equations for a 3X3 patch. We solve this using a \"Least Squares\" approach, which looks very familiar to the **Harris Corner Detector** you just learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\sum I_x^2 & \\sum I_x I_y \\\\ \\sum I_x I_y & \\sum I_y^2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix} = - \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum I_x I_t \\\\ \\sum I_y I_t \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Insight:** If the matrix on the left is invertible (meaning it has two large eigenvalues), the movement  can be solved reliably. This is exactly why we use **Shi-Tomasi \"Good Features to Track\"** to initialize Lucas-Kanade!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The KLT Algorithm (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi)\n",
    "\n",
    "The KLT algorithm is the standard implementation. It combines the previous concepts into a robust pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detection:** Use Shi-Tomasi to find \"trackable\" corners (the best features).\n",
    "2. **Tracking:** Use the Lucas-Kanade method to find where those corners moved in the next frame.\n",
    "3. **Refinement:** Repeat for every frame, discarding features that become too distorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV provides `cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK`, which includes an **image pyramid** to handle large motions (just like SIFT and SURF use pyramids to handle scale).\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Tracking Methods\n",

    "| Method | Core Idea | Best For... |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Lucas-Kanade** | Local differential method (gradients) | Small, consistent motion of points. |\n",
    "| **Mean Shift** | Finding the \"peak\" of a color histogram | Large objects with a distinct color. |\n",
    "| **Kalman Filter** | Predicting future position based on velocity/physics | Objects that might be briefly occluded. |"
